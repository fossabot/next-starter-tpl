# NextJS Starter Template

## ðŸ“„ About

This repository contains a [monorepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/what-is-a-monorepo) boilerplate written in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), managed by the [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) package manager.

You can use it with the backend template, written in Laravel â€” [laravel-starter-tpl](https://github.com/wayofdev/laravel-starter-tpl).

### â†’ Purpose

- Establish a **structure** and present a lifecycle perspective (dx, ci/cd, deployments);
- Show how to create and consume shared packages, locales, assets, and API types;
- Ship fully configured repository with integrated **tools & configs**, like tsconfig, eslint, jest, cypress, tailwind, changelogs, versioning, codecov, codeclimate, sentry, and others;
- Clarify some **advantages** of monorepo (team cohesion, consistency, duplication, refactorings, atomic commits)

## ðŸ¤” What's inside?

This turborepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### â†’ Apps

- `docs`: a [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) documentation template generated from [Nextra: Docs Starter Kit](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/documentation-starter-kit)
  - [DEMO docs app](https://next-starter-tpl-docs.vercel.app/)
- `web`: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with tailwindcss and sentry support
  - [DEMO web app](https://next-starter-tpl-web.vercel.app/)
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by the `web` application

> **Note:** Apps should not depend on apps, they can depend on packages

### â†’ Packages

- `common-i18n`: locales for multi-language support
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `jest-config`: [JestJS](https://jestjs.io) configs used across the monorepo

> **Note:** Apps can depend on packages, packages can depend on each others
